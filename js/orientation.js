In the past, we have also taken on projects such as a collaborative zine (“Rice Paper”) and an art installation in Lerner Hall. An example of a particularly successful event was last year’s FOLKSLAM, which provided Asian American slam poetry stars with the space to “rewrite the book” of traditional oral history. The two-hour event featured five poets—Kit Yan, Jess X. Chen, Ocean Vuong, Paul Tran, and Cathy Linh Che—as well as three student opening acts. </p> </li> <li><p>Meeting Place: Lerner 401</p> </li> <li><p>Meeting Time: Every Monday at 10:00 PM!

Anyone, regardless of class year or experience, can apply to be an APAHM event chair, and you’ll find that nothing brings people together more than the responsibility, stress, and unexpected hilarity of producing a successful Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Also, members of CU APAHM get to enjoy a lot of free food.
